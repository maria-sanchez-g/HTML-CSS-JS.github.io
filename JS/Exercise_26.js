//In JavaScript, every object has an internal property called [[Prototype]], which is a reference to another object. That object is called the prototype.
//When you use new with that function, the new objectâ€™s [[Prototype]] points to that .prototype.
//Prototype structure:
// function Car(make, model) {
//   this.make = make;
//   this.model = model;
// }
// Car.prototype.description = function () {
//   console.log(`This car is a ${this.make} ${this.model}`);
// };
// const car1 = new Car("Porsche", "911");
// const car2 = new Car("Ferrari", "F8");
// car1.description(); // "This car is a Porsche 911"
// car2.description(); // "This car is a Ferrari F8"

//description is stored once on Car.prototype.
//Both car1 and car2 share the same description function via the prototype chain.

//Object.setPrototypeOf() and Object.create() are ways to work directly with prototypes, they let you manually control inheritance.
//Object.setPrototypeOf(), changes the prototype of an existing object
//Object.create(), creates a new object with its prototype set to the given object.
