â€¢Full-Stack E-commerce Application: Developed a web application with a Node.js and Express backend and a Vanilla JavaScript frontend. Designed a layered architecture (Services, Controllers, Routes) to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability. Implemented create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations through RESTful API endpoints with JSON parsing and an in-memory data store. Built a responsive HTML/CSS interface that dynamically interacts with the backend using fetch calls, handling state management, DOM rendering, and user interactions (add, update, delete, and toggle items). Configured the server to serve both static assets and API routes, demonstrating full-stack development skills from server setup to client-side integration.
