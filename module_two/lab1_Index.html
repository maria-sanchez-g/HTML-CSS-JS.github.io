      <h2>About Raiz</h2>
      <p>What began as a simple passion for working with timber has grown into a craft that fills homes with warmth, beauty, and meaning. 
      At <span style="font-weight:bold;">Raiz</span>, every plate, mug, bowl, or table starts with a raw piece of wood — pine, walnut, jarrah, elm, red gum, elderbox, rose mahogany, silky oak, blue gum, or blackwood — each chosen for its unique grain and character. 
      I shape them by hand, using traditional woodturning and woodcraft techniques, and often pair them with flowing resin designs that capture the elegance of nature. 
      Over time, I have expanded my creations to include <span style="font-style: italic;">cap holders, book stands, phone holders, boxes, chopping boards, napkin holders, and coasters</span>, all designed to be as functional as they are beautiful.
      </p>

      <pre>Every piece carries the story of the tree it came from and the hours of care put into crafting it, making it more than just an object — it becomes part of your home’s story too.
      </pre>
