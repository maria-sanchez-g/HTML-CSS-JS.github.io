<!-- When you first ran npm init or used some template, it created a basic folder structure with a public folder for static files.

This folder is used only when you want your backend to serve a front-end (HTML, CSS, JS).

For example:

app.use(express.static("public"));


But you did not add that line, so Express is not using public/. -->
